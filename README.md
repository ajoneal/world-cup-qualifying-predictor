Things to discuss in analysis/presentation:

soccer difficult to predict, only predicting 14 games

not a lot of people use regression to predict goals scored (most predict outcome/use classification)

recommend trying another model(random forest regressor), looking at weighting the rankings so they don't as heavily impact predicted scores, look to add more stats, possibly using a RNN model to predict home/away goals for/against averages in the upcoming fixtures
